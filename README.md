## Overview 
Flight Price Prediction is the project of regression problem . It helps to predict the Flight Price on the basis of **Airline**, **Source**, **Destination**, **Number of Stops**, **Date of Journey**

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to build Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all machine learning models. So I land up in making this project.

## Libraries Used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib.pyplot
4. Seaborn 
5. Sklearn

## Model Used
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Lasso 
3. Random Forest Regressor

## Score Obtained From Models
1. Support Vector Machine  - 0.3979351686726069
2. Lasso                   - 0.6195705840291943
